# Stock Price Prediction App ðŸ“ˆ


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f37d0cac-3b51-4f78-b9c0-71f6751bd028)


This Flask-based web application uses a trained LSTM model to predict stock prices for the next 12 days based on the previous 12 days' prices. Users can input stock prices for the last 12 days, and the app will forecast the next 12 days and display a visual representation of the predictions.

## Features
- Predict stock prices for the next 12 days using past data.
- Visualize predictions with an interactive plot.
- User-friendly and engaging front-end for an enhanced user experience.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
    cd stock-price-prediction
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Add the model and scaler files:**
   - Ensure that `lstm_main_model.h5` and `scaler.pkl` are placed in the root directory. These files contain the trained LSTM model and the scaler object used for preprocessing input data.

5. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

6. **Access the application:**
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter the stock prices for the last 12 days in the input fields.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to generate predictions.
4. View the predicted stock prices and the interactive plot.
